'i realized i was living someone else’s dream, not mine,' he confessed. one morning, after a particularly taxing meeting, elijah made a bold decision —he quit his job without a backup plan. the months that followed were filled with uncertainty and soul-searching. he spent his days journaling, volunteering at a local food bank, and hiking in nearby forests. 'i had to strip everything away to figure out what really mattered,' he said. gradually, elijah discovered a passion for woodworking, something he had enjoyed as a teenager but had long abandoned. he began making small furniture pieces in his garage, sharing them online. the response was overwhelmingly positive. people appreciated the craftsmanship and sincerity in his work. soon, he turned his hobby into a full-time business. 'it’s not just about selling chairs,' elijah explained. 'it’s about building something real —with my hands and my heart.' today, he runs a modest but thriving workshop, mentoring young artisans who feel lost in traditional career paths. 'success isn’t about titles or paychecks,' he reflects. 'it’s about waking up excited for the day ahead.' elijah’s journey from burnout to fulfillment has inspired many to rethink their own definitions of happiness and purpose."

'i had worked for over twenty years without a break,' he said. 'then suddenly, everything stopped.' with bills piling up and job applications going unanswered, jonathan struggled to remain hopeful. he began working small gigs—fixing neighbors’ plumbing, painting fences, and even delivering groceries. 'i did whatever i could to keep food on the table,' he recalled. the emotional toll was immense. jonathan avoided family gatherings, ashamed of his situation. 'i felt like i had failed my kids.' but a turning point came when a former colleague offered him a temporary role in a warehouse. it wasn’t what he was used to, but it restored his sense of purpose. over time, jonathan’s dedication led to a permanent position and, eventually, a managerial role. today, he uses his experience to mentor others facing unemployment. 'you have to keep moving forward, even when it hurts,' he says. his journey stands as a reminder that resilience often begins in the moments we feel most broken."

    "content": "text: on april 24, 2019, i was in my shop at 6964 coyote run, bryan, tx, working on a volkswagen engine. it had been raining hard most of the afternoon. at approximately 4:30 pm, the rain stopped and there was an eerie silence followed by the patter of what sounded like hail on the metal roof of the shop. then the wind started howling, followed by a large crashing noise on the back wall of the shop. i looked up and saw the 16 ft garage door bowing inward from the wind. i thought, “oh no, i hope it’s not a tornado ” the door breathed back out. i sighed a breath of relief hoping the twister had skipped over the shop. that relief was short lived as in the next few seconds, i heard the rain sound, which actually sounded like a thrashing machine metal being chewed up, indescribable actually. then the entire back wall of the shop began to bow in. all i could think of was getting to a low spot. there was none. my next thought was getting to an interior hall, so i ran to the bathroom, laid down on the floor, and grabbed the toilet knowing it was bolted to the ground. in the next 2-5 seconds, i saw the corner of the shop and bathroom lift up and disappear over me. then i was hit with a force i cannot describe and felt myself being lifted into the air traveling backwards at what seemed like 100 mph. i was being hit from all directions by objects and beams from the building. a thousand thoughts went through my mind, and i just knew i was dead. i prayed for god to save me, then i was slammed back onto the ground. i realized i was alive and did not think i was hurt too badly. the debris started falling out of the sky. i thought, “oh great, i survived being sucked up into the air in a tornado, now i’m going to be crushed to death!” as the debris fell onto me, i fough t, pushed, and shoved anything that landed on me. then as fast as it started it was over. no noise. i was bleeding, and it felt like my ankle was broken, but i was alive. i couldn’t breathe because i was being crushed. i pushed one more time and was able to create enough space to breathe. i hollered for someone to get the building off me, but no one answered. i wiped the blood from my eyes and saw a 1965 pontiac catalina next to me. my first thought was why is that car in the bathroom with me. then it hit me that i was some 80 ft from where the bathroom once stood and was out in the parking lot in front of the shop. i pushed and clawed my way out of the rubble, shocked, angry, and thankful to god that i was alive. i survived, bruised from head to toe with a broken foot and some lacerations. i went back out to the shop the next day and just cried seeing where i had crawled out from the broken pieces of the toilet under where i laid. turns out the toilet had just been set on the wax ring and caulked to the floor, not one bolt in the slab. in retrospect, that toilet not being secured is probably what saved me as i think i was traveling with the debris in the twister, not sitting still being struck by the debris field."

(2) these mini-profile episodes — filmed in somaliland, kenya, sudan, rwanda and ghana —highlight how these women are breaking barriers, challenging their communities and creating new industries and markets — all while making their own rules in unfamiliar surroundings. (3) navalayo osembo resigned from her united nations (un) job in new york t o move back to kenya and start enda: africa's first running shoe company. sahar arrayer left her job in the uk as a doctor to move back to sudan to start a fashion brand that pays homage to the diversity and beauty of sudanese women. nathalie munyampenda gave up a well paying job with the canadian government and moved back to rwanda to work with the next einstein forum (nef) at the african institute for mathematical sciences (aims). (4) while the involvement of the african diaspora in the continent's development has significantly increased over the past decade, very few of these stories have been documented. we hope that the homecoming series will spark a broader conversation around those who return to africa. we also hope to help inform those in the diaspora thinking about moving back to the continent and those already in africa on how they can help re-integrate their brothers and sisters. (5) ultimately, the mission of these series is to provide a counter-narrative to the singular story of africa and migration. the notion that africans only move out of africa and not vice versa."

    "content": "text: (1) the brain drain or human capital flight is the emigration of highly skilled individuals to other nations due to conflicts, lack of opportunity, and health hazards in their home countries. investment in higher education is lost and in vain when a trained individual leaves and doesn’t return. also, whatever capital the individual has been a part of is reduced by their departure. the term brain drain was used to describe the outflow of scientists and technologists to canada and the usa in the 1950’s. (2) its counterpart is brain gain in the areas to which talented people migrate. brain drain can occur either when individuals who study abroad do not return to their home country or when individuals educated in their home country emigrate for higher wages. the second form is worse because it drains more resources from the home country. (3) this phenomenon is perhaps more problematic for developing nations where it is widespread. in these countries, higher education and professional certification are often viewed as the surest path to escape from a troubled economy or difficult political situation. (4) even though little has been said about the implications of the brain drain in africa, it is believed to be one of the biggest issues for developing nations. it has cost the african continent over $ 4 billion in the employment of 150.000 expatriate professionals annually. ethiopia for instance has lost 75% of its skilled workforce between 1980 and 1991, which harms the ability of such nations to get out of poverty.(5) nigeria, kenya, and ethiopia are believed to be the most affected. in the case of ethiopia, the country produced many excellent doctors but there are more ethiopian doctors in chicago than there are in ethiopia. thabo mbeki, the south african president, said in his 1998 “african renaissance” speech: “i dream of the day when these intellectuals will return to add to the african pool of brain power, to enquire into and find solutions to africa’s problems, to open the african door to the world of knowledge, to elevate africa’s place within the universe of research, new knowledge, education, and information”."
